> To encrypt something using RSA algorithm you need modulus and encryption exponent pair (n, e) which is your public key. To decrypt something using RSA algorithm you need modulus and decryption exponent pair (n, d) which is your private key.To encrypt something using RSA public key you treat your plaintext as a number and raise it to the power of e modulus n : ciphertext = ( plaintext ^ e) mod nTo decrypt something using RSA private key you treat your ciphertext as a number and raise it to the power of d modulus n : plaintext = ( ciphertext ^ d) mod n[**â€” golem**](#)
