In this article, I will share with you how I have published my first NPM package.

But, first of all, what is NPM ?

Here is the definition in [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)>)

> NPM is the default **package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js**. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry

Nowadays, in software engineering, when we what to add a feature in our software, most of the time we find that we have already a library/package that we can reuse and help us achieve our needs. And this is very wonderful in our domain :)

Today, we are going to publish our first NPM package, so other people can be reused and here the steps that I have followed to achieve that:

1. Create an account on the NPM public registry. Here is the NPM [documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-new-npm-user-account) on how to create your account

2. Create a folder with the following files:

   <p class="code-tabs"></p>

   - package.json

     ```json
     {
       "name": "@ahenteti/hello-npm",
       "version": "1.0.0",
       "description": "Hello NPM from @ahenteti",
       "main": "index.js",
       "type": "module",
       "keywords": ["hello-npm"],
       "author": "Ahmed HENTETI (https://ahenteti.github.io)",
       "license": "MIT",
       "scripts": {},
       "repository": {
         "type": "git",
         "url": "https://github.com/ahenteti/hello-npm.git"
       }
     }
     ```

   - index.js

     ```js
     const helloNpm = () => {
       console.log('hello npm!');
     };

     export default helloNpm;
     ```

   - README.md

     ```md
     ## Hello NPM from @ahenteti

     ## Installation

     Run `npm install @ahenteti/hello-npm`

     ## Usage

     \`\`\`

     import hello from @ahenteti/hello-npm

     hello();

     \`\`\`
     ```

   The `package.json` file is the entry point of our package where we define properties like the **name**, **description**, ... of the package

   For instance, the property **main** points to the file **index.js** where we define the logic of our package.

3. When ready, run the command `npm publish --access=public` to publish your package

Voil√†, now you can check your NPM account and verify your package
